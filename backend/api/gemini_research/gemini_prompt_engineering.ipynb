    "**Cybersecurity Readiness Report for Valier School District**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** July 18, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This report evaluates the cybersecurity posture of Valier School District based on technical scans (DNS, DMARC, and port scanning) and a self-reported security questionnaire. The findings reflect a strong commitment to foundational cybersecurity practices across user access, email protection, network exposure, and staff awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Organizational Information**\n",
    "- **Organization Name:** Valier School District\n",
    "- **Email Domain:** valier.k12.mt.us\n",
    "- **Website Domain:** www.valier.k12.mt.us\n",
    "- **External IP (Firewall):** 216.220.16.170\n",
    "- **Website Hosting IPs:** 216.239.32.21, 216.239.34.21, 216.239.36.21, 216.239.38.21\n",
    "- **DNS Hosting:** Managed by University of Montana (umt.edu nameservers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Security Questionnaire Review**\n",
    "| Security Control | Status |\n",
    "| :--------------: | :----: |\n",
    "| MFA for Email | Yes |\n",
    "| MFA for Computer Login | Yes |\n",
    "| MFA for Sensitive Systems | Yes |\n",
    "| Acceptable Use Policy | Yes |\n",
    "| New Employee Security Awareness Training | Yes |\n",
    "| Annual All-Employee Security Training | Yes |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** The district reports complete implementation of basic cyber hygiene practices, especially user authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication) and routine training. This indicates a proactive and policy-driven approach to risk mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. DNS & Email Security**\n",
    "\n",
    "**DNS Records**\n",
    "- DNS is managed by the University of Montana (cudess1.umt.edu, cudess2.umt.edu), suggesting centralized and professionally administered DNS.\n",
    "- A records point to IPs within Google's network (likely Google Sites hosting for web content).\n",
    "**MX Records (Email)**\n",
    "- The district uses Google Workspace (Gmail) for email, as shown by multiple aspmx.l.google.com MX records.\n",
    "- SPF record is correctly configured: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:mg.infinitecampus.org -all\n",
    "    - This helps mitigate spoofing by defining authorized mail senders.\n",
    "**DMARC Record**\n",
    "- A valid DMARC record exists with a **reject** policy: v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@valier.k12.mt.us\n",
    "    - This instructs receiving servers to reject unauthenticated mail, providing strong protection against phishing.\n",
    "**Conclusion:** DNS and email protections (SPF, DMARC, and hosting security) are configured correctly and follow best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Port Scanning Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Website Hosting (Google IP: 216.239.32.21)**\n",
    "- **Port 80 (HTTP):** Open\n",
    "- **Port 443 (HTTPS):** Open\n",
    "These are expected for a publicly accessible website and are typical for Google-hosted services.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Firewall / External IP (216.220.16.170)**\n",
    "- **All scanned ports are closed**\n",
    "This is a strong sign of network perimeter hardening and good firewall configuration. No externally exposed services were found on the organization's primary IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Risk Assessment & Readiness Summary**\n",
    "| Category | Status | Notes |\n",
    "| :------: | :----: | :---: |\n",
    "| Authentication Security | Strong | MFA is required across key systems |\n",
    "| Email Security | Strong | SPF and DMARC with \"reject\" policy in place |\n",
    "| Network Exposure | Secure | No exposed services on the external firewall IP |\n",
    "| Web Hosting | Secure | Google-hosted; limited attack surface |\n",
    "| Policy & Training | Comprehensive | Acceptable use policies and regular training in place |\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Recommendations**\n",
    "Although the cybersecurity readiness is solid, continuous improvement is essential. We recommend the following:\n",
    "1. **Verify DKIM**: While SPF and DMARC are configured, ensure **DKIM** is also active for all sending domains.\n",
    "2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Consider regular internal and external vulnerability assessments of network devices and servers.\n",
    "3. **Incident Response Plan**: Document and regularly test a cybersecurity incident reponse and disaster recovery plan.\n",
    "4. **Asset Inventory**: Maintain a regularly updated inventory of hardware/software assets and monitor for unauthorized changes.\n",
    "5. **Third-party Risk**: Evaluate vendors (e.g., Infinite Campus) for their security psture, especially since they're included in SPF.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Valier School District demonstrates a strong cybersecurity foundation, particularly in authentication, email protection, staff training, and perimeter security. Continued vigilance and regular audits will help maintain and improve this strong security posture.\n",
    "\n",

      "Of course! Here is an explanation of cybersecurity in simple terms, using an analogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Imagine Your Digital Life is a House\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of all your online information—your email, bank account, social media, photos—as being inside your house.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Your Data is Your Stuff:** Your money, photos, and private documents are the valuable things you keep inside.\n",
      "*   **Your Devices are the Doors & Windows:** Your phone, laptop, and tablet are the ways to get into your house.\n",
      "*   **Your Passwords are the Keys:** You need the right key to open a door.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cybersecurity, in this case, is simply your home security system.**\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s everything you do to protect your house and the valuable stuff inside from burglars (hackers and scammers).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### What a Home Security System (Cybersecurity) Includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Strong Locks (Strong Passwords)**\n",
      "    You wouldn't use the same flimsy key for your front door, back door, and car. Similarly, you should use different, complex passwords for each of your online accounts. A bad password like \"12345\" is like leaving your key under the doormat.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **A Deadbolt or Second Lock (Two-Factor Authentication - 2FA)**\n",
      "    This is one of the best security upgrades you can make. It means that even if a burglar steals your key (your password), they still can't get in because they also need a second thing, like a special code sent to your phone. It's like needing a key *and* a fingerprint to open the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Checking Who's at the Door (Avoiding Phishing Scams)**\n",
      "    Sometimes, a scammer will dress up as a delivery person or a utility worker to trick you into opening the door. This is what a \"phishing\" email or text is. It looks like it's from a company you trust (like your bank or Amazon) and tries to trick you into giving them your key (password) or letting them into your house. Cybersecurity means being suspicious and not just opening the door to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **An Alarm System (Antivirus & Firewalls)**\n",
      "    This is software that actively looks for burglars trying to sneak in. Antivirus software detects and removes bad programs (malware) that could spy on you or damage your things. A firewall acts like a security guard at your gate, checking who is allowed to come in and go out.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Fixing Cracks in the Walls (Software Updates)**\n",
      "    Over time, small cracks or weaknesses might appear in your house's foundation or walls. Software updates are like a construction crew that comes to fix those weak spots so burglars can't exploit them to get in. That's why it's so important to keep your apps and devices updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### In a Nutshell:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cybersecurity is the practice of keeping your digital life safe.** It's not just about technology; it's also about habits. Just like you lock your doors at night, good cybersecurity involves creating strong passwords, being cautious about suspicious messages, and keeping your software up-to-date to protect your valuable information from people who want to steal it.\n"

Security Questionnaire Review**\\n| Security Control | Status |\\n| :--------------: | :----: |\\n| MFA for Email | Yes |\\n| MFA for Computer Login | Yes |\\n| MFA for Sensitive Systems | Yes |\\n| Acceptable Use Policy | Yes |\\n| New Employee Security Awareness Training | Yes |\\n| Annual All-Employee Security Training | Yes |\\n\\n**Summary:** The district reports complete implementation of basic cyber hygiene practices, especially user authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication) and routine training. This indicates a proactive and policy-driven approach to risk mitigation.\\n\\n**4. DNS & Email Security**\\n\\n**DNS Records**\\n- DNS is managed by the University of Montana (cudess1.umt.edu, cudess2.umt.edu), suggesting centralized and professionally administered DNS.\\n- A records point to IPs within Google's network (likely Google Sites hosting for web content).\\n**MX Records (Email)**\\n- The district uses Google Workspace (Gmail) for email, as shown by multiple aspmx.l.google.com MX records.\\n- SPF record is correctly configured: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:mg.infinitecampus.org -all\\n\\t- This helps mitigate spoofing by defining authorized mail senders./n**DMARC Record**/n- A valid DMARC record exists with a **reject** policy: v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@valier.k12.mt.us\\n\\t- This instructs receiving servers to reject unauthenticated mail, providing strong protection against phishing./n**Conclusion:** DNS and email protections (SPF, DMARC, and hosting security) are configured correctly and follow best practices.\\n\\n**5. Port Scanning Results**\\n\\n**Website Hosting (Google IP: 216.239.32.21)**\\n- **Port 80 (HTTP):** Open\\n- **Port 443 (HTTPS):** Open\\nThese are expected for a publicly accessible website and are typical for Google-hosted services.\\n\\n**Firewall / External IP (216.220.16.170)**\\n- **All scanned ports are closed**\\nThis is a strong sign of network perimeter hardening and good firewall configuration. No externally exposed services were found on the organization's primary IP.\\n\\n**6. Risk Assessment & Readiness Summary**\\n| Category | Status | Notes |\\n| :------: | :----: | :---: |\\n| Authentication Security | Strong | MFA is required across key systems |\\n| Email Security | Strong | SPF and DMARC with \\\"reject\\\" policy in place |\\n| Network Exposure | Secure | No exposed services on the external firewall IP |\\n| Web Hosting | Secure | Google-hosted; limited attack surface |\\n| Policy & Training | Comprehensive | Acceptable use policies and regular training in place |\\n\\n**7. Recommendations**\\nAlthough the cybersecurity readiness is solid, continuous improvement is essential. We recommend the following:\\n1. **Verify DKIM**: While SPF and DMARC are configured, ensure **DKIM** is also active for all sending domains.\\n2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Consider regular internal and external vulnerability assessments of network devices and servers.\\n3. **Incident Response Plan**: Document and regularly test a cybersecurity incident reponse and disaster recovery plan.\\n4. **Asset Inventory**: Maintain a regularly updated inventory of hardware/software assets and monitor for unauthorized changes.\\n5. **Third-party Risk**: Evaluate vendors (e.g., Infinite Campus) for their security psture, especially since they're included in SPF.\\n\\n**8. Conclusion**\\n\\nValier School District demonstrates a strong cybersecurity foundation, particularly in authentication, email protection, staff training, and perimeter security. Continued vigilance and regular audits will help maintain and improve this strong security posture.\\n\\n**Prepared by:**\\n\\nCybersecurity Assessment Team\\n\\n**Date:** July 18, 2025\"\n",
