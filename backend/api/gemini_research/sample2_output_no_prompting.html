<p><strong>Cybersecurity Readiness Report for G.A.S. Inc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date:</strong> October 14, 2025</p>
<p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
<p>This report provides an assessment of the cybersecurity readiness of G.A.S. Inc. based on a review of technical scans (DNS and port scanning) and a self-reported security questionnaire. The findings indicate a significant number of critical vulnerabilities and a general lack of foundational cybersecurity controls. The organization's current posture exposes it to a high risk of email-based attacks, network intrusion, and ransomware. Immediate action is required to address the identified weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>2. Organizational Information</strong>
- <strong>Organization Name:</strong> G.A.S. Inc.
- <strong>Email Domain:</strong> gasinc.net
- <strong>Website Domain:</strong> www.gasinc.net
- <strong>External IP / Firewall:</strong> 104.28.1.189</p>
<p><strong>3. Security Questionnaire Review</strong>
| Security Control | Status |
| :--- | :---: |
| MFA for Email | No |
| MFA for Computer Login | No |
| MFA for Sensitive Systems | Yes |
| Acceptable Use Policy | No |
| New Employee Security Awareness Training | No |
| Annual All-Employee Security Training | No |</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The questionnaire reveals a concerning lack of basic security policies and user protections. While MFA is used for some sensitive systems, its absence on email and computer logins creates significant risk. Furthermore, the lack of employee training and acceptable use policies indicates a low level of security awareness and governance within the organization.</p>
<p><strong>4. DNS &amp; Email Security</strong></p>
<p><strong>MX Records (Email)</strong>
- The organization uses a third-party provider, <code>mailhostbox.com</code>, for its email services.</p>
<p><strong>SPF Record</strong>
- A Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record exists: <code>"v=spf1 include:spf.mailhostbox.com ~all"</code>
- The <code>~all</code> (soft fail) qualifier is a weak configuration. It suggests to receiving servers that unauthenticated mail should be accepted but marked as suspicious, offering minimal protection against spoofing.</p>
<p><strong>DMARC Record</strong>
- A DNS query for the DMARC record <code>(_dmarc.gasinc.net)</code> returned <code>NXDOMAIN</code>, indicating <strong>no DMARC record exists</strong>.
- This is a critical vulnerability. Without DMARC, the organization has no policy to instruct email providers on how to handle fraudulent emails sent on its behalf, making it highly susceptible to phishing and brand impersonation attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The email security configuration is weak and incomplete. The combination of a soft-fail SPF record and the complete absence of a DMARC policy leaves the organization and its contacts vulnerable to sophisticated email-based attacks.</p>
<p><strong>5. Port Scanning Results</strong></p>
<p><strong>Firewall / External IP (104.28.1.189)</strong>
A scan of the primary external IP address revealed numerous open ports, suggesting a poorly configured firewall and a large attack surface.
- <strong>Port 21 (FTP):</strong> Open - Insecure protocol for file transfer.
- <strong>Port 22 (SSH):</strong> Open - Secure Shell, a common target for brute-force attacks.
- <strong>Port 25 (SMTP):</strong> Open - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, can be abused for spam relaying.
- <strong>Port 80 (HTTP):</strong> Open - Standard web traffic.
- <strong>Port 110 (POP3):</strong> Open - Insecure email retrieval protocol.
- <strong>Port 443 (HTTPS):</strong> Open - Secure web traffic.
- <strong>Port 3389 (RDP):</strong> Open - Remote Desktop Protocol, a primary vector for ransomware attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Exposing services like FTP, SSH, POP3, and especially RDP directly to the public internet is extremely dangerous and deviates from security best practices. This configuration presents an immediate and critical risk of unauthorized access and network compromise.</p>
<p><strong>6. Risk Assessment &amp; Readiness Summary</strong>
| Category | Status | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Authentication Security | Weak | No MFA for email or computers, which are primary entry points for attackers. |
| Email Security | Poor | Weak SPF configuration and a complete lack of DMARC. High risk of spoofing. |
| Network Exposure | Critical | Numerous high-risk ports (FTP, SSH, RDP) are open on the firewall. |
| Policy &amp; Training | Poor | No security awareness training or acceptable use policy in place. |</p>
<p><strong>7. Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>The following actions are recommended to mitigate the identified risks, prioritized by urgency.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate (Critical Priority):</strong>
1.  <strong>Firewall Hardening:</strong> Immediately close all unnecessary ports on the external firewall (104.28.1.189). At a minimum, ports <strong>21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 25 (SMTP), 110 (POP3), and 3389 (RDP)</strong> should be blocked from public access. Access to services like RDP and SSH should be restricted to a secure VPN.
2.  <strong>Implement MFA:</strong> Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users on email accounts and computer logins to prevent unauthorized access from compromised credentials.</p>
<p><strong>High Priority:</strong>
3.  <strong>Implement DMARC:</strong> Create and publish a DMARC record. Start with a monitoring policy (<code>p=none</code>), then quickly advance to <code>p=quarantine</code> and finally <code>p=reject</code> to block fraudulent emails.
4.  <strong>Strengthen SPF:</strong> Change the SPF record from <code>~all</code> (soft fail) to <code>-all</code> (hard fail) to instruct receiving servers to reject mail from unauthorized sources.
5.  <strong>Implement DKIM:</strong> Work with the email provider (<code>mailhostbox.com</code>) to enable DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) to further secure against email tampering and spoofing.</p>
<p><strong>Medium Priority:</strong>
6.  <strong>Develop Security Policies:</strong> Establish and enforce a formal Employee Acceptable Use Policy to set clear guidelines for technology use.
7.  <strong>Conduct Security Awareness Training:</strong> Implement a mandatory security awareness training program for all new hires and conduct annual refresher training for all employees to educate them on threats like phishing.</p>
<p><strong>8. Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>G.A.S. Inc. currently demonstrates a very low level of cybersecurity readiness. The combination of an exposed network perimeter, weak authentication controls, inadequate email security, and a lack of security policies and training places the organization at an exceptionally high risk of a significant cybersecurity incident, such as a data breach or ransomware attack. The recommendations outlined in this report should be addressed with the utmost urgency to establish a baseline of security and protect the organization's assets and reputation.</p>
