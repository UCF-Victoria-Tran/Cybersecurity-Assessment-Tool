    "text": "**Cybersecurity Readiness Report for Valier School District**\n\n**Date:** July 18, 2025\n\n**1. Overview**\n\nThis report evaluates the cybersecurity posture of Valier School District based on technical scans (DNS, DMARC, and port scanning) and a self-reported security questionnaire. The findings reflect a strong commitment to foundational cybersecurity practices across user access, email protection, network exposure, and staff awareness.\n\n**2. Organizational Information**\n- **Organization Name:** Valier School District\n- **Email Domain:** valier.k12.mt.us\n- **Website Domain:** www.valier.k12.mt.us\n- **External IP (Firewall):** 216.220.16.170\n- **Website Hosting IPs:** 216.239.32.21, 216.239.34.21, 216.239.36.21, 216.239.38.21\n- **DNS Hosting:** Managed by University of Montana (umt.edu nameservers)\n\n**3. Security Questionnaire Review**\n| Security Control | Status |\n| :--------------: | :----: |\n| MFA for Email | Yes |\n| MFA for Computer Login | Yes |\n| MFA for Sensitive Systems | Yes |\n| Acceptable Use Policy | Yes |\n| New Employee Security Awareness Training | Yes |\n| Annual All-Employee Security Training | Yes |\n\n**Summary:** The district reports complete implementation of basic cyber hygiene practices, especially user authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication) and routine training. This indicates a proactive and policy-driven approach to risk mitigation.\n\n**4. DNS & Email Security**\n\n**DNS Records**\n- DNS is managed by the University of Montana (cudess1.umt.edu, cudess2.umt.edu), suggesting centralized and professionally administered DNS.\n- A records point to IPs within Google's network (likely Google Sites hosting for web content).\n**MX Records (Email)**\n- The district uses Google Workspace (Gmail) for email, as shown by multiple aspmx.l.google.com MX records.\n- SPF record is correctly configured: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:mg.infinitecampus.org -all\n\t- This helps mitigate spoofing by defining authorized mail senders./n**DMARC Record**/n- A valid DMARC record exists with a **reject** policy: v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@valier.k12.mt.us\n\t- This instructs receiving servers to reject unauthenticated mail, providing strong protection against phishing./n**Conclusion:** DNS and email protections (SPF, DMARC, and hosting security) are configured correctly and follow best practices.\n\n**5. Port Scanning Results**\n\n**Website Hosting (Google IP: 216.239.32.21)**\n- **Port 80 (HTTP):** Open\n- **Port 443 (HTTPS):** Open\nThese are expected for a publicly accessible website and are typical for Google-hosted services.\n\n**Firewall / External IP (216.220.16.170)**\n- **All scanned ports are closed**\nThis is a strong sign of network perimeter hardening and good firewall configuration. No externally exposed services were found on the organization's primary IP.\n\n**6. Risk Assessment & Readiness Summary**\n| Category | Status | Notes |\n| :------: | :----: | :---: |\n| Authentication Security | Strong | MFA is required across key systems |\n| Email Security | Strong | SPF and DMARC with \"reject\" policy in place |\n| Network Exposure | Secure | No exposed services on the external firewall IP |\n| Web Hosting | Secure | Google-hosted; limited attack surface |\n| Policy & Training | Comprehensive | Acceptable use policies and regular training in place |\n\n**7. Recommendations**\nAlthough the cybersecurity readiness is solid, continuous improvement is essential. We recommend the following:\n1. **Verify DKIM**: While SPF and DMARC are configured, ensure **DKIM** is also active for all sending domains.\n2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Consider regular internal and external vulnerability assessments of network devices and servers.\n3. **Incident Response Plan**: Document and regularly test a cybersecurity incident reponse and disaster recovery plan.\n4. **Asset Inventory**: Maintain a regularly updated inventory of hardware/software assets and monitor for unauthorized changes.\n5. **Third-party Risk**: Evaluate vendors (e.g., Infinite Campus) for their security psture, especially since they're included in SPF.\n\n**8. Conclusion**\n\nValier School District demonstrates a strong cybersecurity foundation, particularly in authentication, email protection, staff training, and perimeter security. Continued vigilance and regular audits will help maintain and improve this strong security posture.\n\n**Prepared by:**\n\nCybersecurity Assessment Team\n\n**Date:** July 18, 2025"
